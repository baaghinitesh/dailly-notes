## Summary of Approach

The Java solution to convert a binary number represented as a singly linked list to an integer iterates through the linked list.  Each node represents a bit (0 or 1).  The algorithm starts with an integer result initialized to 0.  It then iterates through the linked list, multiplying the current result by 2 (left-shifting) and adding the value of the current node. This effectively builds the integer representation of the binary number.

## Time and Space Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.  The algorithm iterates through the linked list once.
- Space Complexity: O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the size of the linked list.  Only a few variables are used to store the current node, the result integer, and potentially a temporary variable.
