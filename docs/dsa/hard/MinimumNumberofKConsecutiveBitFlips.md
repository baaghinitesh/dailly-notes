## Summary of Approach

The Java solution to the "Minimum Number of K Consecutive Bit Flips" problem typically uses a sliding window approach with a deque (double-ended queue).  The deque stores the indices of flips made so far.  As the window slides through the binary array (represented as an integer array), it maintains a count of flipped bits within the window. If the count of flipped bits is even (meaning the current bit is 0, after potential prior flips), a flip is needed.  A flip is executed by adding the current index to the deque. If the leftmost element of the deque is outside the current window, it is removed. This ensures the deque only contains relevant flip indices within the current window.  The algorithm iterates through the array, incrementing a flip count whenever a flip is necessary. The final flip count represents the minimum number of K consecutive bit flips required.


## Time and Space Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of the input array.  The algorithm iterates through the array once.  Deque operations (add and remove) are O(1) on average.
- Space Complexity: O(n) in the worst case. The deque can store up to n/k indices in the worst-case scenario, where k is the length of the consecutive flips.  However, in practice, it's usually much smaller than n.  If K is significantly larger than n, the space complexity tends towards O(k).
