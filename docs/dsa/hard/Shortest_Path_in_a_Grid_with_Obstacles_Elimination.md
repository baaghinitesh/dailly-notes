# Problem: Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination

## Summary of Approach

The "Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination" problem aims to find the shortest path from a starting point to an ending point in a grid, where some cells are obstacles.  A crucial element is that the path can eliminate a limited number of obstacles.  This usually involves using a variation of Dijkstra's algorithm or a breadth-first search (BFS).

The core idea is to augment the state representation to include not only the current cell's coordinates but also the number of obstacles already eliminated.  This creates a larger search space.  The algorithm explores the grid, maintaining a priority queue (for Dijkstra's) or a queue (for BFS) of states, prioritizing states with shorter distances.  For each visited cell, it checks if moving to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) is possible.  If a cell is an obstacle, it's only considered if the remaining obstacle elimination budget is greater than zero.  The algorithm terminates when the ending point is reached, returning the shortest path found.  Variations might involve using A* search for even faster performance by incorporating heuristics.

## Time and Space Complexity
- Time: O(M * N * K), where M and N are the dimensions of the grid and K is the maximum number of obstacles that can be eliminated.  This is because the algorithm explores a state space proportional to the grid size multiplied by the number of possible obstacle elimination counts. Using a priority queue optimized for updates like a Fibonacci heap would reduce this to O(M*N*K log(M*N*K)), but standard priority queues like min-heap are typically sufficient.
- Space: O(M * N * K). This is due to the need to store visited states, which are (x, y, obstacles_eliminated) tuples.  The queue/priority queue also uses space proportional to the size of the explored portion of this state space.

## Java Solution
```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

class ShortestPathInAGridWithObstaclesElimination {
    // Question: You are given an m x n integer matrix grid where each cell is either 0 (empty) or 1 (obstacle). You can move up, down, left, or right from a cell. You can eliminate at most k obstacles in your path. Find the shortest path from the top left cell (0, 0) to the bottom right cell (m-1, n-1). If the shortest path is not possible, return -1.
    // Difficulty: Hard

    public int shortestPath(int[][] grid, int k) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;

        if (m == 0 || n == 0) return -1;

        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(new int[]{0, 0, k, 0}); // {row, col, remainingObstacles, distance}

        boolean[][][] visited = new boolean[m][n][k + 1];
        visited[0][0][k] = true;

        int[][] dirs = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}};

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] curr = queue.poll();
            int row = curr[0];
            int col = curr[1];
            int obstacles = curr[2];
            int dist = curr[3];

            if (row == m - 1 && col == n - 1) return dist;

            for (int[] dir : dirs) {
                int newRow = row + dir[0];
                int newCol = col + dir[1];

                if (newRow >= 0 && newRow < m && newCol >= 0 && newCol < n) {
                    int newObstacles = obstacles - grid[newRow][newCol];
                    if (newObstacles >= 0 && !visited[newRow][newCol][newObstacles]) {
                        visited[newRow][newCol][newObstacles] = true;
                        queue.offer(new int[]{newRow, newCol, newObstacles, dist + 1});
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }
}
