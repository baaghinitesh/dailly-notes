## Summary of Approach

The Shortest Superstring problem aims to find the shortest string that contains all given strings as substrings.  Several approaches exist, but a common and relatively efficient one involves using a greedy algorithm combined with a graph representation.

The algorithm typically works as follows:

1. **Overlap Graph Construction:** Create a directed graph where each node represents a string from the input set.  The weighted edges represent the overlap between pairs of strings.  The weight of an edge from string `a` to string `b` is the length of the maximum overlap between the suffix of `a` and the prefix of `b`.

2. **Finding a Hamiltonian Path:** The problem then reduces to finding a Hamiltonian path (a path that visits each node exactly once) in the overlap graph that minimizes the total weight. This is an NP-hard problem, so heuristics are often used.  A common greedy approach iteratively selects the edge with the maximum weight (longest overlap) and merges the corresponding strings until all strings are combined.  This doesn't guarantee the absolute shortest superstring, but provides a good approximation.

3. **String Construction:** Once a Hamiltonian path is found, the strings are concatenated based on the order determined by the path, removing the overlapping portions to construct the shortest superstring (according to the heuristic).


## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time:** O(n^2 * m + n^3)  where 'n' is the number of strings and 'm' is the maximum length of a string.  The O(n^2 * m) term comes from computing the overlap between all pairs of strings. The O(n^3) term arises from the greedy algorithm for finding a Hamiltonian path (which can be implemented with algorithms like Held-Karp, although simpler heuristics are frequently used that may have different complexities).  Note that the exact time complexity depends heavily on the chosen heuristic for finding the Hamiltonian path. A naive approach could be much worse.

- **Space:** O(n * m)  This is primarily due to storing the overlap graph (an adjacency matrix or similar representation) and the input strings. The space required to store intermediate results during string concatenation is relatively small compared to this.
