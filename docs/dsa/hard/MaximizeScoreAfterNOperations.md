## Summary of Approach

The problem "Maximize Score After N Operations" involves selecting pairs of numbers from a given array such that the product of each pair's indices plus the product of the numbers themselves contributes to a total score. The goal is to maximize this score after performing N operations.  A key observation is that we can't just greedily pick the pairs with the highest scores at each step because that could prevent optimal pairings later on.

The most efficient approach uses dynamic programming (DP) to solve this problem.  We define a DP state `dp[i][mask]` representing the maximum score achievable after `i` operations, where `mask` is a bitmask indicating which numbers have already been used.  The DP transition considers all possible pairs of unused numbers and updates the score accordingly.  The algorithm iterates through all possible states, updating the maximum score at each step until `N` operations are complete. The final answer is the maximum score achievable in `dp[N][mask]` across all possible masks after `N` operations.  A bitmask is used for efficient tracking of selected numbers.


## Time and Space Complexity
- Time: O(N * 2<sup>M</sup> * M), where N is the number of operations and M is the number of numbers in the input array. This is because there are N operations, 2<sup>M</sup> possible masks (subsets of numbers), and potentially M operations to find a pair within each mask.

- Space: O(N * 2<sup>M</sup>).  This is the space used to store the DP table `dp[i][mask]`.
