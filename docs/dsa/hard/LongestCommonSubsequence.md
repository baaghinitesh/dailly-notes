## Summary of Approach

The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem aims to find the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two).  A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.  The approach typically uses dynamic programming.  A matrix (or table) is constructed where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the LCS of the first `i` elements of the first sequence and the first `j` elements of the second sequence.  The matrix is filled iteratively:

- If the `i`-th element of the first sequence equals the `j`-th element of the second sequence, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1` (we extend the LCS by one).
- Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])` (we take the longer LCS from either omitting the `i`-th element of the first sequence or the `j`-th element of the second sequence).

The value `dp[m][n]` (where `m` and `n` are the lengths of the two sequences) represents the length of the LCS.  To reconstruct the actual LCS, one can backtrack through the matrix from `dp[m][n]`.


## Time and Space Complexity
- Time: O(mn) where 'm' and 'n' are the lengths of the two input sequences. This is because the algorithm iterates through an m x n matrix.
- Space: O(mn)  The space complexity is dominated by the size of the dynamic programming matrix.  While space optimization techniques exist to reduce this to O(min(m, n)), the basic approach uses O(mn) space.
