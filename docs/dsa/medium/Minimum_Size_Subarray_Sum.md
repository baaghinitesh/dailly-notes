# Problem: Minimum Size Subarray Sum

## Summary of Approach

The "Minimum Size Subarray Sum" problem aims to find the minimum length of a contiguous subarray within a given array whose sum is greater than or equal to a specified target value.  The most efficient approach typically uses a sliding window technique.  This involves maintaining a window of elements and adjusting its size.  The window's sum is tracked.  If the sum is less than the target, the window's right boundary is expanded (adding a new element). If the sum is greater than or equal to the target, the window's left boundary is contracted (removing an element) to try and find a smaller subarray that still meets the criteria. The minimum window size encountered during this process is the solution.  If no such subarray exists, a specific value (often 0 or -1) is returned to indicate this.


## Time and Space Complexity
- Time: O(N) where N is the length of the input array. This is because each element in the array is visited at most twice (once when the window's right boundary expands and at most once more when it contracts).
- Space: O(1). The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space to store variables like window sum, left and right pointers, and minimum window size.  It does not use any auxiliary data structures that scale with the size of the input.

## Java Solution
```java
// Question: Given an array of positive integers nums and an integer target, return the minimum length of a subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to target. If no such subarray exists, return 0 instead.
// Difficulty: Medium

class MinimumSizeSubarraySum {
    public int minSubArrayLen(int target, int[] nums) {
        int minLen = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int windowStart = 0;
        int windowSum = 0;

        for (int windowEnd = 0; windowEnd < nums.length; windowEnd++) {
            windowSum += nums[windowEnd];

            while (windowSum >= target) {
                minLen = Math.min(minLen, windowEnd - windowStart + 1);
                windowSum -= nums[windowStart];
                windowStart++;
            }
        }

        return minLen == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? 0 : minLen;
    }
}
