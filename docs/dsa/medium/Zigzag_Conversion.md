# Problem: Zigzag Conversion

## Summary of Approach

The "Zigzag Conversion" problem aims to convert a given string into a zigzag pattern with a specified number of rows.  The algorithm iterates through the string, assigning characters to rows in a zig-zag manner. This is achieved by moving downwards until the last row is reached, then upwards until the first row is reached, and repeating this cycle.  The converted string is formed by concatenating the characters row by row.  A common approach uses an array of strings (or a similar data structure) to store the characters for each row during the zigzag traversal, and then joins the rows at the end.  Alternatively, one could directly construct the output string by calculating the correct index in the output based on the zigzag pattern.

## Time and Space Complexity
- Time: O(n) where n is the length of the input string.  The algorithm iterates through the string once to assign characters to rows. The concatenation of rows is also a linear operation.
- Space: O(n) in the worst case (when the number of rows is 1 or n).  This is because we need to store the characters in a data structure, which could hold all the characters of the input string.  If the number of rows is significantly smaller than n, the space complexity might be O(n*k), where k is the number of rows (although this is still linear in the case of a constant k).  A more optimized solution may reduce this to O(k) where k is the number of rows if it constructs the output string directly without storing all intermediate strings.

## Java Solution
```java
// Question: The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (You may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)
// P   A   H   N
// A P L S I I G
// Y   I   R
// And then read line by line: "PAHNAPLSIIG"
// Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows:
// Difficulty: Medium

class ZigzagConversion {
    public String convert(String s, int numRows) {
        if (numRows == 1 || numRows >= s.length()) return s;

        StringBuilder[] sb = new StringBuilder[numRows];
        for (int i = 0; i < numRows; i++) sb[i] = new StringBuilder();

        int i = 0;
        int down = 0;
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            sb[i].append(c);
            if (i == numRows - 1) down = 1;
            else if (i == 0) down = 0;

            i += down == 0 ? 1 : -1;
        }

        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (StringBuilder str : sb) result.append(str);

        return result.toString();
    }
}
