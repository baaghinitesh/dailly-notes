## Summary of Approach

The problem "Longest Mountain in Array" aims to find the length of the longest mountain in a given array. A mountain is defined as a subarray that strictly increases to a peak, then strictly decreases.  The approach involves iterating through the array, identifying potential peaks. For each potential peak, we expand outwards in both directions (left and right) to determine the length of the mountain. We keep track of the maximum mountain length encountered during the iteration.  The algorithm efficiently avoids redundant checks by using a `base` index to track starting points of potential mountains.  It avoids revisiting already processed portions of the array because once a peak is found, it checks left and right for increasing/decreasing sequences, then moves the `base` to the end of the found mountain to continue searching efficiently.


## Time and Space Complexity
- Time: O(N)
- Space: O(1)

The algorithm iterates through the array at most once.  While there are nested loops within the `while` condition, these loops only process elements within a single mountain, and the total number of processed elements remains linear with respect to the input size.  No extra data structures of significant size are used; all operations are performed in-place, resulting in constant space complexity.
