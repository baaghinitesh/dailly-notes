## Summary of Approach

The Array Nesting problem asks to find the length of the longest chain formed by repeatedly accessing array elements using the array element as the index.  The approach involves iterating through the array. For each unvisited element, we start a chain by repeatedly following the index to the next element until we reach an already visited element or form a cycle back to the starting element. The length of this chain is recorded, and the maximum chain length among all chains is returned as the result.  We use a `visited` array to track visited elements efficiently, avoiding infinite loops and redundant computations.


## Time and Space Complexity
- Time: O(N)
- Space: O(N)

**Explanation:**

- **Time Complexity:**  The outer loop iterates through the array once (O(N)). The inner loop follows each chain, but each element is visited at most once across all chains. Therefore, the total number of times we access elements is at most O(N). Even though the nested loop structure might seem O(N^2) at first glance, the amortized analysis reveals it to be linear.

- **Space Complexity:** We use an auxiliary array `visited` of size N to keep track of visited elements.  This contributes to O(N) space complexity.  The recursive approach (if one were used) might add to the call stack space, but that would also be bounded by N in the worst case. Therefore, the overall space complexity remains O(N).
