## Summary of Approach

The Array Nesting problem asks to find the length of the longest chain formed by recursively accessing array elements.  We start at an index `i`, then access the element at that index (let's call it `A[i]`), then access the element at index `A[i]`, and so on until we reach a cycle or an index we've already visited. The length of this chain is the number of unique indices we encounter before a cycle or repetition.  The algorithm iterates through each index in the array as a potential starting point for such a chain, keeping track of the maximum chain length encountered.  We use a `visited` array (or a set) to efficiently detect cycles and avoid redundant computations.


## Time and Space Complexity
- Time: O(N)
- Space: O(N)

The algorithm iterates through the input array of size N once. While the inner loop might appear to be nested, each index is visited at most once due to the `visited` array. Therefore, the total number of operations is proportional to N. The `visited` array (or set) requires space proportional to N to store visited indices.
