## Summary of Approach

The Java solution to merging two binary trees recursively traverses both trees simultaneously.  For each node at a given level in both trees, it creates a new node in the merged tree.  The new node's value is the sum of the corresponding nodes' values in the input trees. If a node is present in only one of the input trees at a specific level, the node from the existing tree is used in the merged tree.  This recursive process continues until all nodes in both input trees have been processed.  The root of the merged tree is returned.


## Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the total number of nodes in both input trees.  This is because each node in both trees is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the taller of the two input trees. This is due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case (a completely unbalanced tree), H can be equal to N, resulting in O(N) space complexity. In the best case (a balanced tree), H is log₂(N), resulting in O(log₂(N)) space complexity.  Therefore, the space complexity is generally expressed as O(H) or O(N) in the worst case.
