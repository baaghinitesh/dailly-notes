## Summary of Approach

The Java solution to the "Decode Ways" problem uses dynamic programming to efficiently count the number of ways to decode a string of digits into a sequence of letters.  Each digit can represent a letter (1-26), and consecutive digits can represent a single letter if their combined value falls within the range 10-26. The solution iteratively builds a `dp` array where `dp[i]` stores the number of ways to decode the substring ending at index `i`. The base cases are `dp[0] = 1` (empty string has one way to decode) and `dp[1] = 1` (a single digit string has one way to decode, unless the digit is 0, in which case it's 0).  The recurrence relation is:

`dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]` if the digits at `i-1` and `i-2` form a valid two-digit code (10-26). Otherwise `dp[i] = dp[i-1]`.  The final result is `dp[n]` where `n` is the length of the input string.  Error handling is included to account for invalid input (like '0' as the first digit).


## Time and Space Complexity
- Time Complexity: O(n) - The algorithm iterates through the input string once.
- Space Complexity: O(n) - The `dp` array of size `n` is used to store intermediate results.  While it could be optimized to O(1) using only two variables to keep track of the last two elements, the provided space complexity reflects a common, easier-to-understand implementation.
